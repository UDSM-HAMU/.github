## UDSM - Modelling and Data Analytics Unit (MDAU)

The UDSM Modelling and Data Analytics Unit (MDAU) champions data-first approaches to strengthen Tanzania's health sector. Based at the University of Dar es Salaam, MDAU blends advanced analytics, operational research, and collaborative systems engineering to turn complex data into actionable insights.

### What we do

- **Data-driven operations and decision support:** Build pipelines, dashboards, and decision-support tools that translate raw health data into timely guidance for clinicians, program managers, and policymakers.
- **Modelling climate-driven diseases:** Develop and validate predictive models that link climate variability to disease dynamics (e.g., malaria, dengue, cholera), enabling early warnings, targeted interventions, and resource optimization.
- **DHIS2-centered integration:** Extend and integrate with DHIS2 to streamline data ingestion, quality checks, analytics, and dissemination—ensuring insights reach the right stakeholders through familiar national systems.

### Why it matters

- Better evidence improves planning, budgeting, and rapid response in public health.
- Climate-sensitive models help anticipate outbreaks and protect vulnerable communities.
- Seamless DHIS2 integration accelerates nationwide visibility and coordinated action.

### How we work

- Partner with ministries, research institutes, and health programs to co-design solutions.
- Combine epidemiology, data science, and software engineering for robust, transparent methods.
- Emphasize reproducibility, open standards, and capacity building for sustainable impact.

### Get involved

We welcome collaborators across health programs, academia, and technology. If you are working on data-driven health operations, climate-informed disease modeling, or DHIS2 interoperability, let's connect and build together.
