## UDSM - Modelling and Data Analytics Unit (MDAU)

The UDSM Modelling and Data Analytics Unit (MDAU) champions data-first approaches to strengthen decision-making across various sectors in Tanzania. Based at the University of Dar es Salaam, MDAU blends advanced analytics, operational research, and software engineering to transform complex data into actionable insights.

### What we do

- **Data-driven operations and decision support:** We build data pipelines, dashboards, and decision-support tools that translate raw data into timely guidance for planners, program managers, and policymakers.
- **Predictive Modelling:** We develop and validate predictive models that link environmental factors (like climate) to outcomes of interest (such as disease dynamics, agricultural yields, or resource availability), enabling early warnings and targeted interventions.
- **System Integration:** We extend and integrate with data systems like DHIS2 to streamline data ingestion, quality checks, analytics, and dissemination—ensuring insights reach the right stakeholders through familiar platforms.

### Why it matters

- Better evidence improves planning, budgeting, and rapid response in public administration and beyond.
- Predictive models help anticipate challenges and protect vulnerable communities and resources.
- Seamless data system integration accelerates nationwide visibility and coordinated action.

### How we work

- Partner with ministries, research institutes, and programs to co-design solutions.
- Combine epidemiology, data science, and software engineering for robust, transparent methods.
- Emphasize reproducibility, open standards, and capacity building for sustainable impact.

### Get involved

We welcome collaborators across government, academia, and technology. If you are working on data-driven operations, predictive modeling, or data interoperability, let's connect.
